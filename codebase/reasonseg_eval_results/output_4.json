The joystick on the left appears to be the one that controls motion direction, as it is positioned in a way that suggests it is used for directional input.\n\nTo identify the most closely matched object, we compare the two joysticks. Both are circular in shape and are used for directional control. The joystick on the left is larger and more prominently positioned, making it the most likely candidate for controlling motion direction in games.\n\nThe joystick on the left has a larger diameter and is more central in the control panel, which aligns with its role as the primary control for motion direction. The joystick on the right is smaller and less central, suggesting it might be used for other functions, such as shooting or jumping.\n\nGiven this analysis, the joystick on the left is the most closely matched object for controlling motion direction in games.\n",
